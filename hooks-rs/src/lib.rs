//! This crate allows you to write XRPL hooks in Rust.
//!
//! Warning: this is a pre-alpha version of the library. It is not recommended to use it in production yet
//! and many things are subject to change or simply not implemented yet.
//!
//! hooks-rs provides a few things for the hook builders:
//!
//! 1. Abstraction over the XRPL Hooks C API
//! 2. A set of pre-built transaction builders, like `XrpPaymentBuilder`
//! 3. Utility methods to make working with hooks easier, such as `max_iter` or `ComparableArray`.
